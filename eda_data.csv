Instructors need to impress that on students. One way to do that is to understand why the student is there in the first place, then relate the material to the student’s needs.  Goal orientation. A strategic perspective. Organize the material in a logical way so that advanced concepts build upon simpler ones. If the student hits a wall, the instructor can focus on the component the student has difficulty mastering.  Effective communication. The capacity to tell a story. The instructor is more effective if the material is presented in a narrative that is memorable and lends itself to a process of beginning, middle and end.  Continuous learning. Willing to be intellectually challenged. The instructor should understand the needs of the students, at their various levels of mastery, and related the evolving technical resources to the evolving application in business.  Comfort with the logic in programming (breaking the complex into the simple). Programming, statistical, technical expertise or a willingness to improve existing knowledge.

221,Chair of Responsible Data Science,$52K-$88K (Glassdoor Est.),"The University of Virginia (UVA) School of Data Science (SDS)has an exciting opportunity for a tenured associate or full professor or an academic general faculty professor, on the practice track, who will also serve as the inaugural Quantitative Foundation Endowed Chair of Responsible Data Science. This is a pivotal position in the development of the School, which was founded with support from the Quantitative Foundation, the largest gift in the university’s 200 year history. A start date is negotiable until August 2021.  As we move to a data-centric society, SDS seeks to distinguish itself through the definition and practice of responsible data science. Such an outcome requires close cooperation between STEM, social science, humanities, policy and law, leading to the iterative development of a culture of responsibility around data and computation. This helps to create a culture that promotes societal benefit and works to educate all stakeholders as to the nefarious as well as unintentional possibilities of the use of data science methods and techniques. The strengths of the UVA in developing global thinkers, trained to be socially responsible leaders makes it an ideal place for responsible data science and a new form of higher education exemplified by the School of Data Science - a “School without Walls.”  The Chair of Responsible Data Science will assume directorship for the fledgling, yet resourced, Center for Data Ethics and Justice within the School. The School does not have departments but rather centers that can be nimble in a rapidly changing field. Responsibilities include maintaining an internationally recognized research program, recruiting faculty and students to build out the program, contributing to the educational mission of the School as we expand an existing Masters in Data Science as well as develop PhD and undergraduate programs. As Center Director, the Chair of Responsible Data Science will become part of the leadership team of the School and play a vital role in shaping its future. The Director position carries with it a 5-year renewable endowed appointment. Depending on the background and interests of the individual, joint or courtesy appointments with other Schools, for example, Law, Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, or the College of Arts and Sciences will be encouraged.  In summary, this important pioneering and possibly non-traditional hire represents a unique opportunity to shape a School committed to pushing the envelope in higher education in a field of unprecedented growth and opportunity where the meaning of responsible data science, while recognized of great import, is yet to be fully defined. The expectation is that the successful candidate will not only be a leader in the field of responsible data science, but also help shape what that means.  Requirements:  Recognizing that the field of data science is in its formative stage, we are interested in applications from a variety of individuals from academia, government, the private sector and non-profits who are considered influential thought leaders at the interface of STEM and humanities. Desirable prerequisites include: National and international recognition in related research and/or application, including a public-facing track record of achievement A demonstrated commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion A demonstrated successful experience, or strong promise, in implementing programs, policies and procedures around academic research and education at all levels A proven ability, or strong promise, to help envision and build an organization An ability to effectively manage direct reports and lead in a highly team-oriented and interdisciplinary environment Highly effective verbal and written skills; ability to engage in collaborative communication, facilitate discussions and bring groups to consensus Expertise in and ability to develop clear written policies, procedures and directions A commitment to the development of student (undergraduate, graduate and life-long learners) focused services and/or programming To be considered for the tenured full Professor (or Associate/full Professor) appointment, candidates must: A terminal degree (e.g., PhD, JD, MD) in an appropriate STEM, social science or humanities field is required to be considered for a tenured appointment at the rank of Associate/Professor To be considered for the academic general faculty Professor (Practice track), candidates must: Equivalent experience is required to be considered for academic general faculty (AGF) on the practice track, at the rank of Professor Sustained excellence in integrating professional experience with the academic mission of the school, and possess recognition for regional, national, or international achievements in the relevant professional field(s).

369,Chair of Responsible Data Science,$39K-$69K (Glassdoor Est.),"The University of Virginia (UVA) School of Data Science (SDS)has an exciting opportunity for a tenured associate or full professor or an academic general faculty professor, on the practice track, who will also serve as the inaugural Quantitative Foundation Endowed Chair of Responsible Data Science. This is a pivotal position in the development of the School, which was founded with support from the Quantitative Foundation, the largest gift in the university’s 200 year history. A start date is negotiable until August 2021.  As we move to a data-centric society, SDS seeks to distinguish itself through the definition and practice of responsible data science. Such an outcome requires close cooperation between STEM, social science, humanities, policy and law, leading to the iterative development of a culture of responsibility around data and computation. This helps to create a culture that promotes societal benefit and works to educate all stakeholders as to the nefarious as well as unintentional possibilities of the use of data science methods and techniques. The strengths of the UVA in developing global thinkers, trained to be socially responsible leaders makes it an ideal place for responsible data science and a new form of higher education exemplified by the School of Data Science - a “School without Walls.”  The Chair of Responsible Data Science will assume directorship for the fledgling, yet resourced, Center for Data Ethics and Justice within the School. The School does not have departments but rather centers that can be nimble in a rapidly changing field. Responsibilities include maintaining an internationally recognized research program, recruiting faculty and students to build out the program, contributing to the educational mission of the School as we expand an existing Masters in Data Science as well as develop PhD and undergraduate programs. As Center Director, the Chair of Responsible Data Science will become part of the leadership team of the School and play a vital role in shaping its future. The Director position carries with it a 5-year renewable endowed appointment. Depending on the background and interests of the individual, joint or courtesy appointments with other Schools, for example, Law, Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, or the College of Arts and Sciences will be encouraged.  In summary, this important pioneering and possibly non-traditional hire represents a unique opportunity to shape a School committed to pushing the envelope in higher education in a field of unprecedented growth and opportunity where the meaning of responsible data science, while recognized of great import, is yet to be fully defined.

Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.  * You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.  * You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.  WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:   * Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.  * Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners.
